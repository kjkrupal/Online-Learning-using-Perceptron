# Online Learning using Perceptron

The project is an implementation of Standard Perceptron algorithm along with passive agressive weight update and averaged perceptron algorithm. The dataset used in this project is Census Income Data Set and is obtained taken from UCI Machine learning repository. The original dataset can be obtained [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).

Before running the program make sure you have all the related python libraries installed. If not, open up a terminal and execute following commands:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
```

To run the program, run the following command on a terminal:

```
python perceptron.py *path to training data* *path to validation data* *path to test data*
```
